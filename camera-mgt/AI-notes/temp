Phase 1 (Pi Node Stack):
Phase 2 (Cloud API & PlateRecognizer):
Phase 3 (Web Dashboard):
Phase 4 (Prometheus Monitoring):
Phase 5 (Self-Healing):
Phase 6 (Auto-Discovery):


Project Scope Summary

  Overall System

  - 500+ car wash locations with Raspberry Pi devices
  - RTSP camera stream processing with snapshot generation
  - License plate recognition via PlateRecognizer API
  - Centralized cloud management with real-time monitoring
  - Self-healing capabilities for automated recovery

  Development Approach

  1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Pi Node application - CRITICAL for operations
  2. Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6): Cloud API & PlateRecognizer - CRITICAL for revenue
  3. Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9): Web Dashboard - HIGH priority
  4. Phase 4 (Weeks 10-11): Prometheus/Grafana monitoring - MEDIUM
  5. Phase 5 (Weeks 12-13): Self-healing systems - MEDIUM
  6. Phase 6 (Weeks 14-15): Auto-discovery - LOW/Nice-to-have

  Key Technical Decisions

  - Pure code implementation (not n8n) for performance and customization
  - Node.js/TypeScript stack for both Pi and cloud
  - Mock service on port 3003 for all phases
  - PostgreSQL + MongoDB for data storage
  - Redis for real-time communication
  - Docker/Kubernetes for deployment

  Critical Success Factors

  - Pi snapshot API must respond in <100ms
  - System must handle 500+ concurrent devices
  - 99.5% uptime target
  - Revenue generation possible by Week 6
