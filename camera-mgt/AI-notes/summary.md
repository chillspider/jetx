⏺ Comprehensive Summary: Car Wash Fleet Management System

  I've now incorporated both prompts. Here's the complete, detailed summary of the entire project:

  Project Overview

  A comprehensive fleet management system designed to manage 500+ car wash locations, each equipped with Raspberry Pi devices that process RTSP
  camera streams, generate snapshots for license plate recognition, and provide centralized cloud management.

  System Architecture

  Core Components:

  1. Edge Devices: Raspberry Pi 4 running Node.js + FFmpeg at each location
  2. Cloud Management: Centralized API and web dashboard
  3. Monitoring Stack: Prometheus + Grafana for observability
  4. Databases:
    - PostgreSQL for configuration and device data
    - MongoDB for logs and time-series metrics
  5. Real-time Communication: Redis for message queuing
  6. API Gateway: Nginx for load balancing and SSL termination

  Data Flow:

  1. Pi devices capture RTSP streams → generate snapshots → cache in memory
  2. Car wash systems request snapshots via API → Pi returns cached image
  3. Pi devices report metrics/status → Cloud management system
  4. Cloud dashboard manages configurations → pushes to Pi fleet
  5. Prometheus scrapes metrics → Grafana visualizes → alerts trigger
